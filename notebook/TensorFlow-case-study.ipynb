    "\n",
    "In this question you are asked to build a base model. The base model that we want to build is composed of a PCA model followed by a classic machine learning classifier. The PCA takes as input the images that have been flattened and creates a representation of the images with few features (the first n principal components). Then, the classifier will classify the images based on this reduced representation. Following the best practices we will create a sklearn Pipeline and pass this pipeline in a grid search to optimize the hyper parameters. You are free to use the classifier that you think will perform best in this pipeline."

Remember that one pattern to consider starting from is alternating ``Con2D`` and ``MaxPooling2D`` layers.  This is often followed by a couple of ``Dense`` layers.  Recall that the output of every Conv2D and MaxPooling2D layer is a 3D tensor of shape (height, width, channels). The output of the last ``Dense`` layer should correspond to the number of classes and generally uses a 'softmax' activation.  Use `model.summary()` to ensure a cohesive architecture."
